#Overview

Part of the Deep Reinforcement Learning Nano Degree(drlnd) from Udacity.


#Environment

Unity's Banana Environment


#Architecture

A Dueling Q-Network to predict the value and advantage differently in two streams.


#Algorithms

Fixed Target Q-Network
Experience Replay
Dueling Q-Network architecture


#Future

For the future additonal algorithms can be implemented to then end up as the Rainbow Algorithm, 
which combines a number of different techniques to improve the Algorithm.
