        min_score (float): The minimum score that needs to be reached, to stop before reaching the maximum 'n_episodes'
        n_episodes (int): maximum number of training episodes
        max_t (int): maximum number of timesteps per episode
        eps_start (float): starting value of epsilon, for epsilon-greedy action selection
        eps_end (float): minimum value of epsilon
        eps_decay (float): multiplicative factor (per episode) for decreasing epsilon
